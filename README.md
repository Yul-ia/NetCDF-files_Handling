# Analysis of CMAP and NCEP/DOE Reanalysis II (Global and East Asia Precipitation Analysis)

### Data source

CMAP | https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cmap.html

NCEP_R2 | https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html

### **Analysis of Datasets from CMAP**

- Average Monthly Rate of Precipitation
    
    For this dataset, the following were analyzed for the global, East Asia, East Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea regions:
    
    - Monthly average
    - Climatic average
    - Anomaly
    - Standard deviation
    - Trend (over 10 years)

### **Analysis of Datasets from NCEP/DOE Reanalysis II**

- Precipitation Rate at Surface
- Forecast of Surface Pressure
- Forecast of U-wind and V-wind at 10 m
- Forecast of Air Temperature at 2 m
    
    For each dataset, the following were analyzed for the global, East Asia, East Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea regions:
    
    - Monthly average
    - Climatic average
    - Anomaly
    - Standard deviation
    - Trend (over 10 years)
